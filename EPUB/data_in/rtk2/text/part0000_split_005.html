				<p class="x2-lesson-text-no-indent">As the title suggests, the present book has been prepared as a companion volume to <span class="no-style-override14">Remembering the Kanji: A Complete Course on How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Japanese Characters. </span>It presumes that the material covered in the first book has already been mastered and concentrates exclusively on the pronunciation of the Japanese characters. Those who approached the study of the kanji in a different manner may find what is in these pages of some use, but it has not been designed with them in mind.</p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">As I explained in the Introduction to the previous volume, if it is the student’s goal to acquire proficiency in using the Japanese writing system, the entire set of “general-use characters” (</span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">常用漢字</span><span class="no-style-override15">) need to be learned. To insist on studying them in the order of importance or frequency generally followed in Japanese schools is pointless if some other order is more effective as a means to that final goal. A moment’s reflection on the matter is enough to dispose of the common bias that the methods employed by those who come to Japanese as a foreign language should mirror the methods used by the Japanese themselves to learn how to read and write. Accumulated experience and education—and in most cases an energetic impatience with one’s own ignorance—distinguish the older student too radically from Japanese schoolchildren to permit basic study habits to be taken over with only cosmetic changes. A clearer focus on the destination should help the older student chart a course more suited to his or her time, resources, and learning abilities—and not just run harder and faster around the same track.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">Perhaps the single greatest obstacle to taking full advantage of one’s privileged position as an adult foreigner is a healthy fear of imposing alien systems on Japanese language structures. But to impose a system on ways of learning a language does not necessarily mean to impose a system on the language itself. To miss this distinction is to risk condemning oneself to the worst sorts of inefficiency for the worst sorts of reasons.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">Obviously the </span><span class="no-style-override14">simplest </span><span class="no-style-override15">way to learn Japanese is as the Japanese themselves do: by constant repetition, without interference, in a closed cultural environment. Applied to the kanji, this involves drilling and drilling and drilling until the forms and sounds become habitual. The simplest way, alas, is also the most time-consuming and frustrating. By adding a bit of organized complexity to one’s study investments, the same level of proficiency can be gained in a fraction of the time. This was demonstrated in the first volume as far as the meaning and writing of the characters are concerned. By isolating these skills and abstracting from any relationship they have to the rest of the language, a firm foundation was laid for the next step, the assignation of sounds or “readings” to the individual characters. That is the subject of this book.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">The earlier volume was described as a “complete course”; the present volume is offered as a “guide.” The differences between the two books are as important as the similarities. While both books are intended to be self-taught and allow individual readers to progress at their own pace, the former traced out a path step by step, in a clearly defined order. Here, however, the material is presented in such a way that it may be followed frame by frame or may be rearranged freely to suit the particular student’s needs. The reason is that the readings of the kanji do not allow for any more than a </span><span class="no-style-override14">discontinuous </span><span class="no-style-override15">systematization: blocks of repeating patterns and clusters of unpatterned material organized under a variety of rubrics. In fact, the only thing ironclad about the method is the assumption that the student already knows what the characters mean and how they are written. Without that knowledge, the systematization becomes all but opaque. In any event, it is important to gain some understanding of how the book as a whole is laid out before deciding how best to make use of it.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">The book falls into two parts of wildly disproportionate length. The first ten chapters cover the Chinese or </span><span class="no-style-override14">on </span><span class="no-style-override15">readings (</span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">音読み</span><span class="no-style-override15">); the last chapter, the Japanese or </span><span class="no-style-override14">kun </span><span class="no-style-override15">readings (</span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">訓読み</span><span class="no-style-override15">). This should not give the impression that the </span><span class="no-style-override14">on</span><span class="no-style-override15"> readings themselves are so much more difficult than the </span><span class="no-style-override14">kun </span><span class="no-style-override15">readings, but only that their systematization requires much more attention. What is more, the method followed in </span><span class="no-style-override16"><a id="103852" href="part0007_split_000.html#chapter-11-anchor" class="calibre7">C</a></span><span class="no-style-override17"><a href="part0007_split_000.html#chapter-11-anchor" class="calibre7">hapter</a></span><span class="no-style-override16"><a href="part0007_split_000.html#chapter-11-anchor" class="calibre7"> </a></span><span class="no-style-override18"><a href="part0007_split_000.html#chapter-11-anchor" class="calibre7">11</a></span><span class="no-style-override15"> is closer to that followed in volume </span><span class="no-style-override19">1</span><span class="no-style-override15"> and can thus be treated in relatively short shrift.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">One of the chief reasons for frustration with the Chinese readings is not that there are so many kanji to read, but that there are so few readings to go around, creating a massive confusion of homonyms to the uninitiated. No sooner does one attempt to establish a set of rules to rein in this phenomenon than exceptions begin to nibble away at one’s principles like termites until the entire construction begins to look like a colossal waste of effort.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">True enough, there are exceptions. A lot of them. But there is also a great deal of consistency which can be sifted out and structured for the learning. The principal aim of the first ten chapters is to isolate these patterns of consistency and use them to the fullest, holding brute memory at bay as long as possible. To this end I have introduced what are called “signal primitives.” By this I mean </span><span class="no-style-override14">primitive elements within the written form which signal a particular Chinese reading. </span><span class="no-style-override15">Since most of these primitive forms were already assigned a meaning in the first book, the strategy should come as a welcome relief and carry you well over one-third of your way through the </span><span class="no-style-override14">on </span><span class="no-style-override15">readings. Whatever readings fall outside the compass of this method are introduced through a variety of devices of uneven difficulty, each assigned its own chapter.</span></p>

				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">First, relating one compound to another by means of similarities of sound is to be avoided at any cost. It merely clutters the mind with useless information. The fact that the two syllables </span><span class="no-style-override14">sensei </span><span class="no-style-override15">can mean teacher (</span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">先生</span><span class="no-style-override15">) or astrology (</span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">占星</span><span class="no-style-override15">) or despotism (</span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">専制</span><span class="no-style-override15">) or oath (</span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">宣誓</span><span class="no-style-override15">), depending on the kanji assigned to them, may come as such a surprise that you are tempted to make some use of the coincidence. Resist the temptation.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">Second, it is best not to try to learn </span><span class="no-style-override14">on </span><span class="no-style-override15">and </span><span class="no-style-override14">kun </span><span class="no-style-override15">readings at the same time for the same character. The idea of “conquering” a character in its entirety will be supported by nearly every textbook on the kanji that you pick up, but is nearly as mistaken as trying to learn to write and read the kanji at the same time. Once you have learned the general-use characters, you will have a much better base from which to learn the meaning, writing, and readings of new characters </span><span class="no-style-override14">en bloc </span><span class="no-style-override15">as you meet them. Until then, cling to the Caesarean principle of “divide and conquer.”</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">Third, with few exceptions, it seems preferable to learn the several possible Chinese readings of a given character as they come up, in isolation from one another. When second or third readings appear, reference to earlier frames will inform you of the fact. You will no doubt notice that the quickest way to complete the information on your flash cards is to rush to I</span><span class="no-style-override20">ndex v</span><span class="no-style-override15"> and start filling them in. If you do, you might end up with a tidy set of cards that are no longer of any use for review, or else find yourself reviewing what you haven’t yet studied. In either case, you would be sidestepping the entire method on which this book is based. Be sure to read the instructions on pages </span><span class="no-style-override19">303</span><span class="no-style-override15">–</span><span class="no-style-override19">5</span><span class="no-style-override15"> before doing anything with your cards.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">Fourth, certain Japanese sounds undergo phonetic alterations when set alongside other sounds. For example, </span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">一本</span><span class="no-style-override15">, </span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">二本</span><span class="no-style-override15">, </span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">三本</span><span class="no-style-override15"> are read </span><span class="no-style-override14">ippon, nihon, sambon, </span><span class="no-style-override15">the syllable </span><span class="no-style-override14">hon</span><span class="no-style-override15"> being like a chameleon that changes to suit its environment. Some of these alterations are regional, some standard. In any case, they are best learned by trial-and-error rather than by a set of rules that are more complex than they are worth.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">Fifth, a word about Chinese compounds (</span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">熟語</span><span class="no-style-override15">, </span><span class="kanji-in-line-82593-12-override">じゅくご</span><span class="no-style-override15">). With a grain of salt, one might compare the blend of Japanese (</span><span class="no-style-override14">kun</span><span class="no-style-override15">)</span><span class="no-style-override14"> </span><span class="no-style-override15">and Chinese (</span><span class="no-style-override14">on</span><span class="no-style-override15">)</span><span class="no-style-override14"> </span><span class="no-style-override15">words to the blend of Anglo-Saxon and Latin-Greek words in English. Generally, our words of Anglo-Saxon root are richer in meaning, vaguer, and more evocative than those of Latin-Greek root, which tend to precision and clarity. For instance, the word “glass” can suggest a whole range of possible images and meanings, but as soon as we substitute its Latin equivalent, “vitrine,” we have narrowed it down to a more concrete meaning. The presence of Chinese words (generally a compound of two or more </span><span class="no-style-override14">on </span><span class="no-style-override15">readings) in Japanese performs a similar narrowing, specifying function, while the native Japanese words reverberate wider and deeper meanings. </span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">In much the same way that we combine Anglo-Saxon words with Latin and Greek words (for example, in the term “fiberglass”), Japanese will occasionally mix </span><span class="no-style-override14">on </span><span class="no-style-override15">and </span><span class="no-style-override14">kun </span><span class="no-style-override15">readings in the same compound. As a rule, I have avoided these in the exemplary compounds. The order of preference in choosing examples was roughly as follows: </span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text-77445-12-override3"><span class="no-style-override19">1</span><span class="no-style-override15">. a compound that includes a reading appearing in a previous frame; </span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text-77445-12-override4"><span class="no-style-override19">2</span><span class="no-style-override15">. a compound in ordinary use;</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text-77445-12-override5"><span class="no-style-override19">3</span><span class="no-style-override15">. a compound that uses a reading to appear soon after the frame in question; </span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text-77445-12-override4"><span class="no-style-override19">4</span><span class="no-style-override15">. the most common or instructive compound; </span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text-77445-12-override4"><span class="no-style-override19">5</span><span class="no-style-override15">. a name of a person or place; </span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text-77445-12-override6"><span class="no-style-override19">6</span><span class="no-style-override15">. rare or archaic compounds. </span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text-no-indent"><span class="no-style-override15">The student is encouraged to substitute familiar compounds at any time for the examples I have chosen.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">Sixth, the use of signal primitives demands the same rigor applied to primitive elements in volume</span><span class="no-style-override20"> </span><span class="no-style-override42">1</span><span class="no-style-override15">. Where a single jot or tittle of difference is present, the element is excluded. Additional attention will have to be paid to the </span><span class="no-style-override14">position </span><span class="no-style-override15">of the primitive, which was not important in the earlier book.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">Seventh, I would register a plea against trying to begin with the two volumes of </span><span class="no-style-override14">Remembering the Kanji </span><span class="no-style-override15">at the same time. I wash my hands (or as Japanese would have it, my feet) of all responsibility for the results. That having been said, there is no reason that these pages cannot be used in conjunction with a set of graded readers. I would only advise that you begin this </span><span class="no-style-override14">after </span><span class="no-style-override15">having worked your way through C</span><span class="no-style-override20">hapters</span><span class="no-style-override15"> </span><span class="no-style-override19">2</span><span class="no-style-override15"> and </span><span class="no-style-override19">5</span><span class="no-style-override15">. The benefit of such an approach is that it enables you to take full advantage of the grammatical and vocabulary drills that such readers provide. </span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">At the same time, the commonly heard advice about learning characters “in context” is one that is not as sensible as it sounds. Even if I learn the English word “troglodytic” in sentences such as “I can trace my ancestors back to the troglodytic age” or “There’s a family of troglodytes in my tool shed,” the word still needs to be learned in the first place. New Japanese vocabulary falls on the foreign ear with much the same impact—totally unrelated to anything we already know. The benefit of a context is that it enables one to drill a number of words and assimilate something of how they relate to one another grammatically and connotatively. Context defines the finer nuances that usage and tradition have affixed to the kanji, but the compounds themselves still need to be learned. For this reason, students who wish systematically to make their way through this book frame by frame need not trouble themselves over the absence of context provided they do not abandon all reading practice in the process.</span></p>
				<p class="x2-lesson-text"><span class="no-style-override15">Eighth and finally, a vigorous warning against the use of </span><span class="no-style-override14">rōmaji </span><span class="no-style-override15">in learning to read Japanese kanji. Get the idea out of your mind that the Roman alphabet is a “crutch” to help you hobble along until you master the </span><span class="no-style-override14">hiragana </span><span class="no-style-override15">and </span><span class="no-style-override14">katakana </span><span class="no-style-override15">syllabaries. It is nothing of the kind. It is rather a slow and self-inflicted amputation that will leave you crippled for the rest of your Japanese-reading years. Not only does the Roman alphabet inflict quirks on your pronunciation, it cultivates a systematic bias against the </span><span class="no-style-override14">kana </span><span class="no-style-override15">that gets harder and harder to uproot. Be patient with the </span><span class="no-style-override14">kana, </span><span class="no-style-override15">and never write Roman letters beneath them. The stricter you are in expelling all </span><span class="no-style-override14">rōmaji </span><span class="no-style-override15">from your study of Japanese words, the quicker you will find that Roman letters become an obstacle to reading and writing, which they are for the Japanese and should be for anyone learning the language.</span></p>
